JARITANET is a comprehensive infrastructure-as-code system that provides secure access to services running on Kubernetes clusters through Cloudflare Tunnels.

> **Fun fact**: This whole setup runs on a 2014 MacBook Pro chilling in a cupboard ðŸ“¦

## System Architecture

The system is built as a monorepo with three main Pulumi packages that deploy in sequence:

1. **Infrastructure Package** - Creates Cloudflare tunnels
2. **Kubernetes Package** - Deploys services and tunnel connectors to K8s
3. **Routes Package** - Configures DNS records and tunnel routing

Additional components include Ansible playbooks for server provisioning, container definitions for custom services, and utility scripts.

## Package Overview

### Infrastructure Package (`packages/infra`)

**Purpose**: Creates and manages Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels that provide secure connectivity to internal services.

**Key Components**:

- `main.ts` - Entry point that creates tunnel resources
- `modules/tunnel.ts` - Tunnel creation logic using Cloudflare provider
- `conf.ts` - Configuration management with Zod validation
- `conf.schemas.ts` - Type-safe configuration schemas

**What it does**:

- Generates cryptographically secure tunnel secrets (256 bytes)
- Creates Cloudflare Zero Trust tunnels with specified names
- Outputs tunnel configuration for use by other packages
- Manages tunnel lifecycle through Pulumi state

**Dependencies**:

- `@pulumi/cloudflare` - Cloudflare resource management
- `@pulumi/random` - Secure secret generation
- `zod` - Runtime type validation

### Kubernetes Package (`packages/k8s`)

**Purpose**: Deploys services to Kubernetes clusters and runs cloudflared daemon to connect services to Cloudflare tunnels.

**Key Components**:

- `main.ts` - Main deployment orchestration
- `templates/service.ts` - Generic Kubernetes service templates
- `templates/cloudflared.ts` - Cloudflared daemon deployment
- `kubeconfig.ts` - Kubernetes cluster authentication
- `references.ts` - Cross-stack resource references

**What it does**:

- Creates a dedicated `jaritanet` namespace in Kubernetes
- Deploys user-defined services from configuration
- Runs cloudflared as a deployment to establish tunnel connections
- Retrieves tunnel tokens from Cloudflare for authentication
- Provides service discovery within the cluster
- Manages service health checking and monitoring

**Configuration**:

- Services are defined with name, hostname, proxy settings, and deployment args
- Cloudflared configuration includes resource limits and replica settings
- Supports custom container images, environment variables, and volume mounts

**Dependencies**:

- `@pulumi/kubernetes` - Kubernetes resource management
- References tunnel resources from infrastructure package

### Routes Package (`packages/routes`)

**Purpose**: Configures DNS records and tunnel routing to make services accessible via custom domains.

**Key Components**:

- `main.ts` - Main routing configuration
- `tunnels/service.ts` - Service ingress and DNS record management
- `tunnels/tunnel-config.ts` - Tunnel configuration for Cloudflare
- `modules/bluesky.ts` - Bluesky protocol DNS configuration
- `modules/fastmail.ts` - Fastmail service DNS configuration

**What it does**:

- Creates DNS records for each service hostname
- Configures tunnel ingress rules to route traffic to services
- Manages domain verification and SSL certificate provisioning
- Integrates with external service modules (Bluesky, Fastmail)
- Maps service URLs to internal Kubernetes service endpoints

**Service Resolution**:
Services are accessed via: `https://hostname` â†’ Cloudflare â†’ Tunnel â†’ `http://service-name.jaritanet.svc.cluster.local`

**Dependencies**:

- References tunnel from infrastructure package
- References services from Kubernetes package
- Manages Cloudflare DNS zones and records

## Configuration System

All packages use Zod schemas for type-safe configuration validation. Configuration is provided through Pulumi config files (YAML) and validated at runtime.

### Infrastructure Configuration

```
cloudflare:
  accountId: string
tunnel:
  name: string
```

### Kubernetes Configuration

```
cloudflare:
  accountId: string
cloudflared:
  name: string
  args: CloudflaredArgs
services:
  - name: string
    hostname: string
    proxied: boolean
    args: ServiceArgs
```

### Routes Configuration

```
serviceStacks: StackReference[]
zones: Zone[]
cloudflare: CloudflareConfig
bluesky: BlueskyConfig
fastmail: FastmailConfig
```

## Deployment Flow

1. **Infrastructure Deployment**: Creates Cloudflare tunnels and generates secrets
2. **Kubernetes Deployment**: Deploys services and establishes tunnel connections
3. **Routes Deployment**: Configures DNS routing and makes services publicly accessible

Each package references outputs from previous deployments using Pulumi StackReferences, ensuring proper dependency ordering.

## Integration Testing

The system includes comprehensive automated integration tests split into two workflows that run every 6 hours to ensure critical infrastructure remains healthy:

### ðŸ“§ Email Integration Tests

Focuses specifically on mail server configuration for **blit.cc**:

- **MX Records**: Verifies Fastmail MX records (in1/in2 at fastmail servers) are properly configured
- **SPF Records**: Checks SPF includes for Fastmail authorization
- **DKIM Records**: Tests all DKIM selectors (fm1-fm4) for domain authentication
- **DMARC Records**: Validates DMARC policy configuration

### ðŸš¨ Automated Issue Management

Both workflows include intelligent issue management:

**Email Issues**: When mail server configuration problems are detected, automatically creates GitHub issues with:

- Detailed diagnostic information for DNS record problems
- Specific debugging commands for mail server troubleshooting
- Auto-resolution when tests pass again

**Service Issues**: When services become unavailable, creates issues highlighting:

- Failed service endpoints and response codes
- Kubernetes pod status and tunnel connectivity guidance
- Cupboard MacBook Pro health check reminders

The split testing approach provides targeted monitoring - critical email infrastructure gets dedicated attention while service availability is monitored separately, ensuring reliable email delivery and service uptime.

## Additional Components

### Ansible Infrastructure (`ansible/`)

Automated server provisioning and configuration management:

**Playbooks**:

- Common system configuration (users, tools, security)
- Homeserver setup (MicroK8s, NFS, Samba, Syncthing)
- Tailscale network integration

**Roles**:

- `common` - Base system configuration
- `users` - User account management
- `microk8s` - Kubernetes cluster setup
- `nfs` - Network file sharing
- `tailscale` - VPN network connectivity

### Container Services (`containers/`)

**File Server Container**:

- Caddy-based HTTP file server with web interface
- CORS-enabled for cross-origin requests
- Automatic gzip/zstd compression
- Security headers and access logging
- Designed for internal network file sharing

### Utility Scripts (`scripts/`)

**Secret Management** (`update-secrets`):

- Reads secrets from `ansible/github-secrets.json`
- Updates GitHub repository secrets via CLI
- Supports multiple repository deployment access
- Used for CI/CD authentication

## Development Tools

**Code Quality**:

- Biome for code formatting and linting
- TypeScript for type safety across all packages
- Lefthook for git hooks and pre-commit checks

**Package Management**:

- Bun as the JavaScript runtime and package manager
- Workspace-based monorepo structure
- Shared dependencies and TypeScript configuration

**Build System**:

- Individual TypeScript compilation per package
- Pulumi for infrastructure deployment
- GitHub Actions integration via secret management

## Security Model

**Network Security**:

- All external traffic routes through Cloudflare's edge network
- Cloudflare Tunnels eliminate need for open firewall ports
- Services remain private and accessible only via authenticated tunnels

**Authentication**:

- Kubernetes cluster access via service account tokens
- Cloudflare API authentication via account IDs and tokens
- Tunnel authentication via cryptographically secure secrets

**Configuration Security**:

- Sensitive values managed through Pulumi configuration encryption
- GitHub secrets for CI/CD authentication
- No hardcoded credentials in source code

This system provides a complete infrastructure solution for securely exposing internal services through Cloudflare's global network while maintaining infrastructure as code practices and type safety throughout the deployment pipeline.
